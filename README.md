🧠 AI-Based Cognitive Learning Pattern Analyzer
Adaptive & Inclusive Learning System
📌 Overview

This project transforms traditional score-based assessment into a behavior-aware adaptive learning system.

It captures student behavioral signals such as retry patterns, topic-wise errors, and difficulty performance to classify learners into cognitive profiles. Based on this analysis, the system dynamically adjusts content difficulty and generates AI-based personalized feedback.

It also includes a Voice-to-Text Accessibility Module to enable physically disabled learners to attempt quizzes independently.
